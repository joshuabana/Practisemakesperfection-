do you know that Nigeria is highest producing cassave country in the world. Thailand has been able to generate over 
1billion dollars revenue.
Bamisol is chemical component derieved from cassave and is used in different toothpaste
So Nigeria  is loosing alot in revenue for cassave by just limiting it to fufu and pounded yam
